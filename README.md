# SPI_crc_wk2529
This Verilog project provides a robust SPI master-slave communication system with integrated CRC8 checksums for data integrity. The master initiates transactions, sending command, address, and data, while the slave validates incoming packets and responds. The design is corrected for reliability, making it a solid base for dependable SPI interfaces.
